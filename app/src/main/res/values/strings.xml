    <!--Sufficient sleep is important for your health, well-being and happiness. When you sleep better, you feel better.-->
    <!--If youâ€™re still having trouble sleeping, try to do some suggestions :-->

    <!--Tip 1 : Exercise during the day which is a great stress reliever and has been shown to improve the quality of-->
    <!--sleep, particularly for insomniacs.-->

    <!--Tip 2 : Be smart about what you eat and drink. Your daytime eating habits play a role in how well you sleep,-->
    <!--especially in the hours before bedtime. Try to make dinnertime earlier in the evening, and avoid heavy,-->
    <!--rich foods within two hours of bed. Also, avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine before bed.-->

    <!--Tip 3 : Wind down and clear your head. Your body needs time to shift into sleep mode, so spend the last hour-->
    <!--before bed doing a calming activity such as reading, using an electronic device such as a laptop can-->
    <!--make it hard to fall asleep, because the particular type of light emanating from the screens of these-->
    <!--devices is activating to the brain</string>-->
